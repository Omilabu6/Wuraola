      question: "What services do you offer exactly?",
      answer:
        "I build modern, responsive websites with clean code and smooth interactions. My main focus is frontend development using React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and GSAP. I also enjoy exploring game development with Unity.",
    },
    {
      question: "I have a design ready. Can you build it?",
      answer:
        "Yes! If you have a design in Figma, XD, or Sketch, I can bring it to life with pixel-perfect precision. If you donâ€™t have a design, I can also suggest layouts and ideas to match your brandâ€™s vibe.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I donâ€™t like the design or the direction?",
      answer:
        "No worries I believe projects are best when theyâ€™re collaborative. I share progress updates so youâ€™re always in the loop, and we can adjust until it feels right for you.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the payment terms for a project?",
      answer:
        "It depends on the scope, but usually, I request a percentage upfront and the rest after delivery. For larger projects, we can break it into milestones.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are you open to collaborations or freelance work?",
      answer:
        "Yes, I enjoy working with others. Whether itâ€™s hackathons, freelance projects, or fun side ideas, Iâ€™m always open to collaborating.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you only build websites?",
      answer:
        "Mostly yes, but not just websites. I also build web apps and love experimenting with animations, motion design, and game development. For me, the web should feel alive, so I often add extra creative touches to make projects more interactive and memorable.",
